Again, my unstructured code may have been my greatest downfall. I found myself often using methods for more than just its purpose, leading to confusing code at times. 

When it comes to keyboard inputs. I found creating the main menu screen way easier than the rest of the requirements. I have tried to implement the Q/R + ENTER but with no success. I came close at times but the implementation was poor so I decided to just comment it out for the best player experience. I also tried to get the arrow keys to work when inputing row/col, but after many tries I chose to focus on the basic requirements first.

I was already very comfortable using ANSCII escape codes, so adding colors to most places was no issue. Except for the placement of marks and winning conditions.

2P works perfectly, whilst 1P does not work. The AI does not want to place marks randomly, and I struggled to change current marks thingy. Mostly due to poor code structure. 

I think with less cluttered and poor structure in teh code, I would complete more requirements. This is something I will try to focus way more on on the next module. 


I also used way too much time on getting my settings.cs to work. Creating a config.txt file if one doesn't exist and pulling language accordingly.
Meaning that if there have been a previous playthrough, the language has been saved. So if it was changed to NO, the current language is also NO. 
I was very happy with the outcome of the language implementation and I think it will help me a lot with the next module.


At least my language is saved locally and works 100% :)
